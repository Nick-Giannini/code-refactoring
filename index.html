    1. Added Alt to images. W3 says that decorations should get alt="" but i didnt know if that would have been acceptable. I added information about the image and let it be known that no important information is being conveyed to the user and that its a decoration. 
    
    2.No IDs are being called in the CSS. Removed the unused IDs. 
    3. Changed div class=content to main 
    4. Changed divs to sections and removed the classes

            <p>

Online Reputation Management gives you the control over what potential customers see when they search for your business.
